**Learning:** Console menu navigation standards differ from web. Users expect 'B' button to act as "Back/Cancel", but this game's original implementation treated 'B' generally as a click/accept in menus, or ignored it for navigation.
**Action:** When implementing menu navigation in retro games, verify if the "Back" action is bound to the standard cancel button (B/Circle). If not, adding it significantly improves modern usability.
